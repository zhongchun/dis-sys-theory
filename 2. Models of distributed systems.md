### How should the genrals decide

- General 1 always attacks, even if no response is received?
   - Send lots of messengers to increase probability that one will get through
   - If all are captured, general 2 does not know about the attack, so general 1 loses
- General 1 only attacks if positive reponse from general 2 is received?
   - Now general 1 is safe
   - But general 2 knows that general 1 will only attack if general 2's response gets through
   - Now general 2 is in the same situation as general 1 in option 1
## 2.2 The Byzantine generals problem
The Byzantine generals problem is proposed by Lamport in 1982.

The challenge in the Byzantine setting is that some generals might be "traitors": they might try to deliberately and maliciously mislead and confuse the other generals.

### The Byzantine generals problem

- Each general is either malicous or honese
- Up to f generals might be malicious
- Honest generals don't know who the malicious ones are
- The malicious generals may collude
- Nevertheless, honest generals must agree on plan
- Theorem: need 3f+1 generals in total  to tolerate f malicious generals
- Cryptography(digital signatures) helps, but problem remians hard
## 2.3 Describing nodes and network behaviour
### System models
Caputure assumptions is a system model consisting of:

- Network behaviour: e.g. message loss
- Node behaviour: e.g. crashes
- Timing behaviour: e.g. latency
### Network behaviour
Assume bidirectional point-to-point communication between two nodes, with one of:

- Reliable (perfect) links: A message is received if and only if  it is sent. Message may be reordered.
- Fair-loss links: Messages may be lost, duplicated or reordered. If you keep retrying, a message eventually gets through.
- Arbitrary links (active adversary): A malicious adversary may interfere with messages(eavesdrop, modify, drop, spoof, replay)

Fair-loss link can turn into a reliable link by continually retransmitting lost messages until they are finally received, and by filtering out duplicated messages on the recipient side.
An arbitrary link can trun into a fair-loss link by cryptographic techniques.
### Node behaviour
Each node executes a specified algorithm, assuming one of the following:

- Crash-stop (fail-stop): A node is faulty if it crashes (at any moment). After crashing, it stops executing forever.
- Crash-recovery (fail-recovery): A node may crash at any moment, losing its in-memory state. It may resume executing sometime later. Data stored on disk survives the crash.
- Byzantine (fail-arbitrary): A node is faulty if it deviates from the algorithm. Faulty nodes may do anything, including crashing ro malicious behaviour.
### Timing behaviour/synchrony (timeing) assumptions
Assume one of the following for network and nodes:

- Synchronous: Message latency no greater than a known upper bound. Nodes execute algorithm at a known speed.
- Partially synchronous: The system is asynchronous for some finite (but unknown) periods of time, synchronous otherwise.
- Asynchronous: Messages can be delayed arbitrarily. Node can pause execution arbitrarily. No timing guarantees at all.
### Violations of synchrony in practice
Networks usually have quite predictable latency, which can occasionally increase:

- Mesage loss requiring retry
- Congestion/contention causing queueing
- Network/route reconfiguration

Nodes usually execute code at a predictable speed, with occasional pauses:

- Operating system scheduling issues, e.g. priority inversion
- Stop-the-world garbage collection pauses
- Page faults, swap, thrashing
## 2.4 Fault tolerance and high availability

- SLO: service-level objective
- SLA: service-level agreement: contract specifying some SLO, penalties for violation
### Achieving high availability: Fault Tolerance

- Failure: system as a whole isn't working
- Fault: some part of the system isn't working
   - Node fault: crash(crash-stop/crash-recovery), deviating from algorithm(Byzantine)
   - Network fault: droping or significantly delaying messages
- Fault tolerance: system as a whole continues working, despite faults (up to some maximum number of faults)
- Single point of failure (SPOF): node/network link whose fault leads to failure
### Failure detectors

- Failure detector: algorithm that detects whether another node is faulty
- Perfect failure detector: labels a node as faulty if and only if it has crashed
- Typical implementation for crash-stop/crash-recovery: send messages, await response, label node as crashed if no reply within some timeout
- Problem: cannot tell the difference between crashed node, temporarily unresponsive node, lost message, and delayed message
### Failure detection in partially synchronous systems
Eventually perfect failure detector:

- May temporarily label a node as crashed, even though it is correct
- May temporarily label a node as correct, even though is has crashed
- But eventually, labels a node a crashed if and only if it has crashed
